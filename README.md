# AgriWebb API Wrapper

https://docs.agriwebb.com

This is a wrapper to the Agriwebb API. It's not complete (much like the API), makes a lot of assumptions, likely needs some refactoring, isn't yet well tested and currently only pulls the two types of reports available (stock reconcilliation and animal load by paddock). Feel free to improve and send me a pull request.

## Usage
You will need to have a valid AgriWebb API key.

See the example.py file for how to use the classes.

## TODO:
Add support for the GraphQL API
